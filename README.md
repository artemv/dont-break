## Install
```
npm install -g dont-break
```

## Use

* Create `.dont-break.json` file in the root of your package,
  list module names that you would like to test as an array.
* Run `dont-break` any time to test latest version of each dependent module
  against the curent code

## Example

2 projects.

1. First project `foo` only exports single variable `module.exports = 'foo';`
2. Second project `foo-user` depends on `foo`.

`foo-user` only works if it gets string `foo` from the module it depends on, like this:
```js
var str = require('foo');
console.assert(str === 'foo', 'value of foo should be "foo", but is ' + str);
```
`foo` has only a single release 0.1.0 that works for `foo-user` project.

The author of `foo` changes code to be `module.exports = 'bar';` and releases it as 0.2.0.
`foo-user` wants to use the latest `foo` so it updates its dependency, not expecting anything
bad - foo's minor version number has been upgraded. In semantic versioning it means no breaking API
changes.

`foo-user` is now broken!

Instead, before publishing new version to NPM, project `foo` can create a file in its
project folder `.dont-break.json` with names of dependent projects to test
```bash
echo '["foo-user"]' > .dont-break.json
```
You can check if the current code breaks listed dependent project by running

```bash
dont-break
```

This will install each dependent project from `.dont-break.json` file into `/tmp/dont-break...` folder,
will run the dependent's unit tests using `npm test` to make sure they work initially, then
will copy the current project into the temp folder, overwriting the previous working version.
Then it will run the tests again, throwing an exception if they stopped working.

In the example case, it will report something like this
```bash
$ dont-break
dependents [ 'foo-user' ]
testing foo-user
  installing foo-user
installed into /tmp/foo@0.0.0-against-foo-user
  npm test
tests work in /tmp/foo@0.0.0-against-foo-user/lib/node_modules/foo-user
copied /Users/gleb/git/foo/* to /tmp/foo@0.0.0-against-foo-user/lib/node_modules/foo-user/node_modules/foo
  npm test
npm test returned 1
test errors:
AssertionError: value of foo should be "foo", but is bar
npm ERR! Test failed.  See above for more details.
npm ERR! not ok code 0
tests did not work in /tmp/foo@0.0.0-against-foo-user/lib/node_modules/foo-user
code 1
FAIL: Current version break dependents
```
The message clearly tells you that the dependent projects as they are right now cannot
upgrade to the version you are about to release.

## Dependencies

You can specify GitHub repos as dependencies, because they most likely will
have tests. For example in `.dont-break.json`

```js
// you can use JavaScript comments in this file .dont-break.json
[
  "https://github.com/bahmutov/dont-break-bar"
]
```

Picking projects to test manually is a judgement call.
Dont-break can fetch top N most downloaded
or most starred dependent modules and save the list.
* run `dont-break --top-downloads <N>` to find top N most downloaded dependent modules,
save to `.dont-break.json` and check.
* run `dont-break --top-starred <N>` to find top N most starred dependent modules,
save to `.dont-break.json` and check.

The above commands overwrite `.dont-break.json` file.

## Configuration options

### Global vs. project-level configuration
You can specify different configuration options on global level or on project level. Following configs are equivalent.
Project level:
```
[
  {
    "name": "project-a",
    "test": "grunt test"
  },
  {
    "name": "project-b",
    "test": "grunt test"
  },
  {
    "name": "project-c",
    "test": "npm test:special"
  }
]
```
Global level:
```
{
  "test": "grunt test",
  "projects": [
    "project-a", 
    "project-b", 
    {
      "name": "project-c",
      "test": "npm test:special"
    }
  ]
}
```
Global level will simplify dont-break config if dependent projects share the same options. Also, options can be 
overriden on project level as in case of "project-c" here.
  
### Test command

You can specify a custom test command per dependent module. For example, to run `grunt test` for `foo-module-name`,
but default command for module `bar-name`, list in `.dont-break.json` the following:

```
[
  {
    "name": "foo-module-name",
    "test": "grunt test"
  },
  "bar-name"
]
```

### Install command

You can specify a custom install command per dependent module. For example, to run `yarn` for `foo-module-name`,
but default `npm install` for module `bar-name`, list in `.dont-break.json` the following:

```
[
  {
    "name": "foo-module-name",
    "install": "yarn"
  },
  "bar-name"
]
```

### Pre-testing with previous package version
By default dont-break first tests dependent module with its published version of current module, to make sure that it 
was working before the update. If this sounds excessive to you you can disable it with {"pretest": false} option: 
```
[
  {
    "name": "foo-module-name",
    "test": "grunt test",
    "pretest": false
  }
]
```
Here "foo-module-name" module will be tested only once, and "bar-name" twise: first with its published version of 
current module, and then with the updated version.   

The "pretest" property can also accept custom script to run for pretesting:
```
[
  {
    "name": "foo-module-name",
    "test": "grunt test",
    "pretest": "grunt test && ./ci/after-pretesting-by-dont-break"
  }
]
```
By default it equals to "test" command.

### Current module installation method

To test dependent package dont-break installs current module inside the dependent package directory. By default it uses
`cd $DEPENDENT_PACKAGE_DIR && npm install $CURRENT_MODULE_DIR`. Other option is using [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) 
for current module - this can be helpful in some cases, e.g. if you need to use `npm install` in postinstall command. 
To use `npm link` method specify {"currentModuleInstall": "npm-link"}: 
```
{
  "currentModuleInstall": "npm-link",
  "projects": ["packageA", "packageB"]
}
```
Default value is {"currentModuleInstall": "npm-install"}. 

### Post-install command

Before testing the dependent package dont-break installs its dev dependencies via `npm install` command run from the
dependency directory. If you need something more you can specify it via "postinstall" config parameter like this:
```
[
  {
    "name": "packageA",
    "postinstall": "npm run update",
    "test": "dont-break-tests-with-my-package.sh"
  }, {
    "name": "packageB",
    "test": "dont-break-tests-with-my-package.sh"
  }
]
```
If specified this command will run first before pretesting the old version of lib (if pretest isn't disabled), then 
after installing current version of lib to dependent package.  
 
### Installation timeout
You can specify a longer installation time out, in seconds, using CLI option

```
dont-break --timeout 30
```

*dont-break* is the opposite of [next-update](https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update)
that one can use to safely upgrade dependencies.

## Setting up second CI for dont-break

I prefer to use a separate CI service specifically to test the current code
against the dependent projects using `dont-break`. For example, the project
[boggle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boggle) is setup this way. The unit tests
are run on [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/bahmutov/boggle) using
pretty standard [.travis.yml](https://github.com/bahmutov/boggle/blob/master/.travis.yml) file

```yml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "0.12"
  - "4"
branches:
  only:
    - master
before_script:
  - npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then I setup a separate build service on [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/bahmutov/boggle)
just to run the `npm run dont-break` command from the `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
    "dont-break": "dont-break --timeout 30"
}
```

We are assuming a global installation of `dont-break`, and the project lists
the projects to check in the
[.dont-break](https://github.com/bahmutov/boggle/blob/master/.dont-break) file.
At the present there is only a single dependent project
[boggle-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boggle-connect).

To run `dont-break` on CircleCI, I created the
[circle.yml](https://github.com/bahmutov/boggle/blob/master/circle.yml) file.
It should be clear what it does - installs `dont-break`, and runs the npm script command.

```yml
machine:
  node:
    version: "0.12"
dependencies:
  post:
    - npm install -g dont-break
test:
  override:
    - npm run dont-break
```

To make the status visible, I included the CircleCI badges in the README file.

```md

```

## Development and testing

This project is tested end to end using two small projects:
[boggle](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boggle) and its dependent
[boggle-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/boggle-connect).

To see open github issues, use command `npm run issues`

To see verbose log message, run with `DEBUG=dont-break ...` environment
variable.
